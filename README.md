# Project Neumann
This project is a first step towards building RISC-V based SoC for embedded/IoT applications. Project Neumann is based on the [PULPino] core from the [PULP] platform with an 12-bit SAR ADC, internal clock and other analog and digital peripherals to build complete embedded solutions.

# Resources
- [PULP]: RISCV platform from ETH Zurich.
