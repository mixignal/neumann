# Project Neumann
This project is a first step towards building RISC-V based SoC for embedded/IoT applications. Project Neumann is based on the [PULPino] core from the [PULP] platform with an 12-bit SAR ADC, internal clock and other analog and digital peripherals to build complete embedded solutions.

# Resources
- [PULP]: Joint effort between ETH Zurich and U. of Bologna for effcient architectures for Ultra Low Power application.
- [PULPino]: Single-core microcontroller system using [RISCY] or zero-riscy. 
- [Rocket Chip]: Free RISC-V core generator maintained by UC Berkeley. 
- [SiFive]: company formed by the original inventors of RISC-V.
